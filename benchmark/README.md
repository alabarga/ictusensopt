## Benchmarking

Build reproduciple pipleline of comparative analysis of multi-omics biomarker discovery tools

- <a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.15252/msb.20178124"> MOFA</a> (2018, Mol. Sys. Biol.)  <br>
  MOFA is originally designed for *unsupervised* integration of multi-omics data. As biomarker discovery problem is feature selection probelm in *supervised* task, we fed a logistic regression model with patient representation generated by MOFA to measure the predictive power of biomarkers.
